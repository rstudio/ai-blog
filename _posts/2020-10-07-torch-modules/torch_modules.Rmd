[Last
week](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/posts/2020-10-01-torch-network-from-scratch),
we started learning about `torch` basics by coding a simple neural
network from scratch, making use of just a single of `torch`'s features:
*tensors*. [On
Monday](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/posts/2020-10-05-torch-network-with-autograd),
we immensely simplified the task, replacing manual backpropagation with
*autograd*. Today, we *modularize* the network - in both the habitual
and a very literal sense: Low-level matrix operations are swapped out
for `torch` `module`s.

## Modules

From other frameworks (Keras, say), you may be used to distinguishing
between *models* and *layers*. In `torch`, both are instances of
`nn_Module()`, and thus, have some methods in common. For those thinking
in terms of "models" and "layers", I'm artificially splitting up this
section into two parts. In reality though,
there is no dichotomy: New modules may be composed of existing ones up
to arbitrary levels of recursion.

### Base modules ("layers")

Instead of writing out an affine operation by hand -- `x$mm(w1) + b1`,
say --, as we've been doing so far, we can create a linear module. The
following snippet instantiates a linear layer that expects three-feature
inputs and returns a single output per observation:

```{r}
library(torch)
l <- nn_linear(3, 1)
```

The module has two parameters, "weight" and "bias". Both have already
been initialized:

```{r}
l$parameters
```

    $weight
    torch_tensor 
    -0.0385  0.1412 -0.5436
    [ CPUFloatType{1,3} ]

    $bias
    torch_tensor 
    -0.1950
    [ CPUFloatType{1} ]

Modules are callable; calling a module executes its `forward()` method,
which for a linear layer just matrix-multiplies input and weights and
adds the bias.

Let's try this:

```{r}
data  <- torch_randn(10, 3)
out <- l(data)
```

Unsurprisingly, `out` now holds some data:

```{r}
out$data()
```

    torch_tensor 
     0.2711
    -1.8151
    -0.0073
     0.1876
    -0.0930
     0.7498
    -0.2332
    -0.0428
     0.3849
    -0.2618
    [ CPUFloatType{10,1} ]

In addition though, it knows what will need to be done, should ever it
be asked to calculate gradients:

```{r}
out$grad_fn
```

    AddmmBackward

(You may remember from the preceding post that when we work with tensors
directly, we need to create them passing `requires_grad = TRUE` to
achieve this. With modules, `torch` correctly assumes that we'll want to
perform backpropagation at some point.)

By now though, we haven't called `backward()` yet. Thus, no gradients
have yet been calculated:

```{r}
l$weight$grad
l$bias$grad
```

    torch_tensor 
    [ Tensor (undefined) ]
    torch_tensor 
    [ Tensor (undefined) ]

Let's change this:

```{r, error = TRUE}
out$backward()
```

    Error in (function (self, gradient, keep_graph, create_graph)  : 
      grad can be implicitly created only for scalar outputs (_make_grads at ../torch/csrc/autograd/autograd.cpp:47)

Why the error? *Autograd* expects the output tensor to be a scalar,
while in our example, we have a tensor of size `(10, 1)`. This error
won't often occur in practice, where we work with *batches* of inputs
(sometimes, just a single batch). But still, it's interesting to see how
to resolve this.

To make the example work, we introduce a -- virtual -- final aggregation
step -- taking the mean, say. Let's call it `avg`. If such a mean were
taken, its gradient with respect to `l$weight` would be obtained via the
chain rule:

$$
\begin{equation*} 
 \frac{\partial \ avg}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial \ avg}{\partial \ out}  \ \frac{\partial \ out}{\partial w}
\end{equation*}
$$

Of the quantities on the right side, we're interested in the second. We
need to provide the first one, the way it would look *if really we were
taking the mean*:

```{r}
d_avg_d_out <- torch_tensor(10)$`repeat`(10)$unsqueeze(1)$t()
out$backward(gradient = d_avg_d_out)
```

Now, `l$weight$grad` and `l$bias$grad` *do* contain the respective
gradients:

```{r}
l$weight$grad
l$bias$grad
```

    torch_tensor 
     1.3410  6.4343 -30.7135
    [ CPUFloatType{1,3} ]
    torch_tensor 
     100
    [ CPUFloatType{1} ]

Back to the main thread. Besides `nn_linear()` , `torch` provides pretty
much all the common layers you might hope for. But few tasks are solved
by a single layer. How do you combine them? Or, in the usual lingo: How
do you build *models*?

### Container modules ("models")

Now, *models* are just modules that contain other modules. For example,
if all inputs are supposed to flow through the same nodes and along the
same edges, then `nn_sequential()` can be used to build a simple graph.

For example:

```{r}
model <- nn_sequential(
    nn_linear(3, 16),
    nn_relu(),
    nn_linear(16, 1)
)
```

We can use the same technique as above to get an overview of all model
parameters (two weight matrices and two bias vectors):

```{r}
model$parameters
```

To inspect an individual parameter, make use of its position in the
sequential model. For example:

```{r}
model[[1]]$bias
```

    torch_tensor 
    -0.3714
     0.5603
    -0.3791

     0.4967
     0.1554
    -0.3219
    -0.0266
    [ CPUFloatType{16} ]

And just like `nn_linear()` above, this module can directly be called on
data:

```{r}
out <- model(data)
```

On a composite module like this one, calling `backward()` will
backpropagate through all the layers:

```{r}
out$backward(gradient = torch_tensor(10)$`repeat`(10)$unsqueeze(1)$t())

# e.g.
model[[1]]$bias$grad
```

    torch_tensor 
      0.0000
    -17.8578
      1.6246

     -1.7058
      0.0000
     -9.7897
    [ CPUFloatType{16} ]

And placing the composite module on the GPU will move all tensors there:

```{r}
model$cuda()
model[[1]]$bias$grad
```

    torch_tensor 
      0.0000
    -17.8578

     -1.7058
      0.0000

Now let's see how using `nn_sequential()` can simplify our example
network.

## Simple network using modules

```{r}

### generate training data -----------------------------------------------------

# input dimensionality (number of input features)
d_in <- 3
# output dimensionality (number of predicted features)
d_out <- 1
# number of observations in training set
n <- 100


# create random data
x <- torch_randn(n, d_in)
y <- x[, 1, NULL] * 0.2 - x[, 2, NULL] * 1.3 - x[, 3, NULL] * 0.5 + torch_randn(n, 1)


### define the network ---------------------------------------------------------

# dimensionality of hidden layer
d_hidden <- 32

model <- nn_sequential(
  nn_linear(d_in, d_hidden),
  nn_relu(),
  nn_linear(d_hidden, d_out)
)

### network parameters ---------------------------------------------------------

learning_rate <- 1e-4

### training loop --------------------------------------------------------------

for (t in 1:200) {
  
  ### -------- Forward pass -------- 
  
  y_pred <- model(x)
  
  ### -------- compute loss -------- 
  loss <- (y_pred - y)$pow(2)$sum()
  if (t %% 10 == 0)
    cat("Epoch: ", t, "   Loss: ", loss$item(), "\n")
  
  ### -------- Backpropagation -------- 
  
  # Zero the gradients before running the backward pass.
  model$zero_grad()
  
  # compute gradient of the loss w.r.t. all learnable parameters of the model
  loss$backward()
  
  ### -------- Update weights -------- 
  
  # Wrap in with_no_grad() because this is a part we DON'T want to record
  # for automatic gradient computation
  # Update each parameter by its `grad`
  
  with_no_grad({
    model$parameters %>% purrr::walk(function(param) param$sub_(learning_rate * param$grad))
  })
  
}
```

The forward pass looks a lot better now; however, we still loop through
the model's parameters and update each one by hand. Furthermore, you may
be already be suspecting that `torch` provides abstractions for common
loss functions. In the next and last installment of this series, we'll
address both points, making use of `torch` losses and optimizers. See
you then!
