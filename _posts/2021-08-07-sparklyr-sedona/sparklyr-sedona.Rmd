```

[`sparklyr.sedona`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-sedona/tree/master/R/sparklyr.sedona) is now available
as the `sparklyr`-based R interface for [Apache Sedona](https://sedona.apache.org/).

To install `sparklyr.sedona` from GitHub using
the [`remotes`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/index.html) package
^[`sparklyr.sedona` was not released to CRAN yet at the time of writing.], run

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github(repo = "apache/incubator-sedona", subdir = "R/sparklyr.sedona")
```

In this blog post, we will provide a quick introduction to `sparklyr.sedona`, outlining the motivation behind
this `sparklyr` extension, and presenting some example `sparklyr.sedona` use cases involving Spark spatial RDDs,
Spark dataframes, and visualizations.

## Motivation for `sparklyr.sedona`

A suggestion from the
[mlverse survey results](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/posts/2021-02-17-survey/) earlier
this year mentioned the need for up-to-date R interfaces for Spark-based GIS frameworks.
While looking into this suggestion, we learned about
[Apache Sedona](https://sedona.apache.org/), a geospatial data system powered by Spark
that is modern, efficient, and easy to use. We also realized that while our friends from the
Spark open-source community had developed a
[`sparklyr` extension](https://github.com/harryprince/geospark) for GeoSpark, the
predecessor of Apache Sedona, there was no similar extension making more recent Sedona
functionalities easily accessible from R yet.
We therefore decided to work on `sparklyr.sedona`, which aims to bridge the gap between
Sedona and R.

## The lay of the land^[Yes, pun intended]

We hope you are ready for a quick tour through some of the RDD-based and
Spark-dataframe-based functionalities in `sparklyr.sedona`, and also, some bedazzling
visualizations derived from geospatial data in Spark.

In Apache Sedona,
[Spatial Resilient Distributed Datasets](https://sedona.apache.org/api/javadoc/core/org/apache/sedona/core/spatialRDD/SpatialRDD.html)(SRDDs)
are basic building blocks of distributed spatial data encapsulating
"vanilla" [RDD](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/index.html?org/apache/spark/api/java/JavaRDD.html)s of
geometrical objects and indexes. SRDDs support low-level operations such as Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
transformations, spatial partitioning, and spatial indexing. For example, with `sparklyr.sedona`, SRDD-based operations we can perform include the following:

* Importing some external data source into a SRDD:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(sparklyr)
library(sparklyr.sedona)

sedona_git_repo <- normalizePath("~/incubator-sedona")
data_dir <- file.path(sedona_git_repo, "core", "src", "test", "resources")

sc <- spark_connect(master = "local")

pt_rdd <- sedona_read_dsv_to_typed_rdd(
  sc,
  location = file.path(data_dir, "arealm.csv"),
  type = "point"
)
```

* Applying spatial partitioning to all data points:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
sedona_apply_spatial_partitioner(pt_rdd, partitioner = "kdbtree")

```

* Building spatial index on each partition:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
sedona_build_index(pt_rdd, type = "quadtree")
```

* Joining one spatial data set with another using "contain" or "overlap" as the join predicate:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
polygon_rdd <- sedona_read_dsv_to_typed_rdd(
  sc,
  location = file.path(data_dir, "primaryroads-polygon.csv"),
  type = "polygon"
)

pts_per_region_rdd <- sedona_spatial_join_count_by_key(
  pt_rdd,
  polygon_rdd,
  join_type = "contain",
  partitioner = "kdbtree"
)

```

It is worth mentioning that `sedona_spatial_join()` will perform spatial partitioning
and indexing on the inputs using the `partitioner` and `index_type` only if the inputs
are not partitioned or indexed as specified already.

From the examples above, one can see that SRDDs are great for spatial operations requiring
fine-grained control, e.g., for ensuring a spatial join query is executed as efficiently
as possible with the right types of spatial partitioning and indexing.

Finally, we can try visualizing the join result above, using a choropleth map:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
sedona_render_choropleth_map(
  pts_per_region_rdd,
  resolution_x = 1000,
  resolution_y = 600,
  output_location = tempfile("choropleth-map-"),
  boundary = c(-126.790180, -64.630926, 24.863836, 50.000),
  base_color = c(63, 127, 255)
)
```

which gives us the following:

![Example choropleth map output](images/choropleth-map.png)

Wait, but something seems amiss. To make the visualization above look nicer, we can
overlay it with the contour of each polygonal region:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
contours <- sedona_render_scatter_plot(
  polygon_rdd,
  resolution_x = 1000,
  resolution_y = 600,
  output_location = tempfile("scatter-plot-"),
  boundary = c(-126.790180, -64.630926, 24.863836, 50.000),
  base_color = c(255, 0, 0),
  browse = FALSE
)

sedona_render_choropleth_map(
  pts_per_region_rdd,
  resolution_x = 1000,
  resolution_y = 600,
  output_location = tempfile("choropleth-map-"),
  boundary = c(-126.790180, -64.630926, 24.863836, 50.000),
  base_color = c(63, 127, 255),
  overlay = contours
)
```

which gives us the following:

![Choropleth map with overlay](images/choropleth-map-with-overlay.png)

With some low-level spatial operations taken care of using the SRDD API and
the right spatial partitioning and indexing data structures, we can then
import the results from SRDDs to Spark dataframes. When working with spatial
objects within Spark dataframes, we can write high-level, declarative queries
on these objects using `dplyr` verbs in conjunction with Sedona
[spatial UDFs](https://sedona.apache.org/api/sql/Function/), e.g.
^[This demo requires sparklyr 1.7 or above to generate the required Spark SQL type casts for `ST_Point()` automatically.]
, the
following query tells us whether each of the `8` nearest polygons to the
query point contains that point, and also, the convex hull of each polygon.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
tbl <- DBI::dbGetQuery(
  sc, "SELECT ST_GeomFromText(\"POINT(-66.3 18)\") AS `pt`"
)
pt <- tbl$pt[[1]]
knn_rdd <- sedona_knn_query(
  polygon_rdd, x = pt, k = 8, index_type = "rtree"
)

knn_sdf <- knn_rdd %>%
  sdf_register() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    contains_pt = ST_contains(geometry, ST_Point(-66.3, 18)),
    convex_hull = ST_ConvexHull(geometry)
  )

knn_sdf %>% print()
```

```
