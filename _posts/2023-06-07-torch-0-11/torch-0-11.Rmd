title: "torch 0.11.0"
description: >
  torch v0.11.0 is now on CRAN. This release features much-enhanced support for
  executing JIT operations. We also amended loading of model parameters, and added
  a few quality-of-life improvements, like support for temporarily modifying the default
  torch device, support for specifying data types as strings, and many more.

torch v0.11.0 is now on CRAN! This blog post highlights some of the changes included
in this release. But you can always find the full [changelog](https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/news/index.html)
on the torch website.

## Improved loading of state dicts

For a long time it has been possible to use torch from R to load state dicts (i.e. 
model weights) trained with PyTorch using the `load_state_dict()` function.
However, it was common to get the error:

```
Error in cpp_load_state_dict(path) :  isGenericDict() INTERNAL ASSERT FAILED at
```

This happened because when saving the `state_dict` from Python, it wasn't really
a dictionary, but an **ordered** dictionary. Weights in PyTorch are serialized as [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) files -- a Python-specific format similar to our RDS. To load them in C++, without a Python runtime,
LibTorch implements a pickle reader that's able to read only a subset of the 
file format, and this subset didn't include ordered dicts.

This release adds support for reading the ordered dictionaries, so you won't see
this error any longer. 

Besides that, reading theses files requires half of the peak memory usage, and in
consequence also is much faster. Here are the timings for reading a 3B parameter
model (StableLM-3B) with v0.10.0:

```{r}
system.time({
  x <- torch::load_state_dict("~/Downloads/pytorch_model-00001-of-00002.bin")
  y <- torch::load_state_dict("~/Downloads/pytorch_model-00002-of-00002.bin")
})
```

```
   user  system elapsed 
662.300  26.859 713.484 
```

and with v0.11.0

```
   user  system elapsed 
  0.022   3.016   4.016 
```

Meaning that we went from minutes to just a few seconds.

## Using JIT operations

One of the most common ways of extending LibTorch/PyTorch is by implementing JIT
operations. This allows developers to write custom, optimized code in C++ and
use it directly in PyTorch, with full support for JIT tracing and scripting.
See our ['Torch outside the box'](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/posts/2022-04-27-torch-outside-the-box/)
blog post if you want to learn more about it.

Using JIT operators in R used to require package developers to implement C++/Rcpp 
for each operator if they wanted to be able to call them from R directly. 
This release added support for calling JIT operators without requiring authors to 
implement the wrappers.

The only visible change is that we now have a new symbol in the torch namespace, called
`jit_ops`. Let's load torchvisionlib, a torch extension that registers many different
JIT operations. Just loading the package with `library(torchvisionlib)` will make
its operators available for torch to use - this is because the mechanism that registers
the operators acts when the package DLL (or shared library) is loaded.

For instance, let's use the `read_file` operator that efficiently reads a file
into a raw (bytes) torch tensor.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(torchvisionlib)
torch::jit_ops$image$read_file("img.png")
```

```
torch_tensor
 137
  80
  78
  71
 ...
   0
   0
 103
... [the output was truncated (use n=-1 to disable)]
[ CPUByteType{325862} ]
```

We've made it so autocomplete works nicely, such that you can interactively explore the available
operators using `jit_ops$` and pressing <tab> to trigger RStudio's autocomplete.

## Other small improvements

This release also adds many small improvements that make torch more intuitive:

- You can now specify the tensor dtype using a string, eg: `torch_randn(3, dtype = "float64")`. (Previously you had to specify the dtype using a torch function, such as `torch_float64()`).
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE}
  torch_randn(3, dtype = "float64")
  ```
  
  ```
  torch_tensor
  -1.0919
   1.3140
   1.3559
  [ CPUDoubleType{3} ]
  ```

- You can now use `with_device()` and `local_device()` to temporarily modify the device
  on which tensors are created. Before, you had to use `device` in each tensor
  creation function call. This allows for initializing a module on a specific device:
  
  ```{r}
  with_device(device="mps", {
    linear <- nn_linear(10, 1)
  })
  linear$weight$device
  ```
  
  ```
  torch_device(type='mps', index=0)
  ```
  
- It's now possible to temporarily modify the torch seed, which makes creating
  reproducible programs easier.
  
  ```{r}
  with_torch_manual_seed(seed = 1, {
    torch_randn(1)
  })
  ```
  ```
  torch_tensor
   0.6614
  [ CPUFloatType{1} ]
  ```

## Final remarks

Thank you to all contributors to the torch ecosystem. This work would not be possible without
all the helpful issues opened, PRs you created, and your hard work.

If you are new to torch and want to learn more, we highly recommend the [recently announced](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/posts/2023-04-05-deep-learning-scientific-computing-r-torch/) book 'Deep Learning and Scientific Computing with R `torch`'.
