title: "Introducing mall for R...and Python"
description: >
  We are proud to introduce the {mall} project. With {mall}, you can use a 
  local LLM to run NLP operations recursively over a data frame. (sentiment, 
  summarization, translation, etc). {mall} has been simultaneusly released
  to CRAN and PyPi (as an extension to Polars).

A few months ago, I worked on a workshop to teach how to use Databricks with R.
And while working on it, I stumbled into their custom SQL functions that have the 
["ai_" prefix](https://docs.databricks.com/en/large-language-models/ai-functions.html). 
These functions lets you run NLP against a table by simply using SQL:

```sql
> SELECT ai_analyze_sentiment('I am happy');
  positive

> SELECT ai_analyze_sentiment('I am sad');
  negative
```

To me, it was mind-blowing to find a new way
to integrate LLM's in out daily work as data analysts. I have been used to the
chatting, or code completion. Both of those interfaces focus on helping
us with code and development. This is the first time I found an integration 
point that lets you run use the **LLM against our actual data!**.
