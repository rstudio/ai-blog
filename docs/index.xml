      <title>Deep attractors: Where deep learning meets chaos</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2020-06-24-deep-attractors</link>
      <description>In nonlinear dynamics, when the state space is thought to be multidimensional but all we have for data is just a univariate time series, one may attempt to reconstruct the true space via delay coordinate embeddings. However, it is not clear a priori how to choose dimensionality and time lag of the reconstruction space. In this post, we show how to use an autoencoder architecture to circumvent the problem: Given just a scalar series of observations, the autoencoder directly learns to represent attractors of chaotic systems in adequate dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Easy PixelCNN with tfprobability</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2020-05-29-pixelcnn</link>
      <description>PixelCNN is a deep learning architecture - or bundle of architectures - designed to generate highly realistic-looking images. To use it, no reverse-engineering of arXiv papers or search for reference implementations is required: TensorFlow Probability and its R wrapper, tfprobability, now include a PixelCNN distribution that can be used to train a straightforwardly-defined neural network in a parameterizable way.</description>

      <title>Hacking deep learning: model inversion attack by example</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2020-05-15-model-inversion-attacks</link>
      <description>Compared to other applications, deep learning models might not seem too likely as victims of privacy attacks. However, methods exist to determine whether an entity was used in the training set (an adversarial attack called member inference), and techniques subsumed under "model inversion" allow to reconstruct raw data input given just model output (and sometimes, context information). This post shows an end-to-end example of model inversion, and explores mitigation strategies using TensorFlow Privacy.</description>

      <title>Towards privacy: Encrypted deep learning with Syft and Keras</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2020-04-29-encrypted_keras_with_syft</link>
      <description>Deep learning need not be irreconcilable with privacy protection. Federated learning enables on-device, distributed model training; encryption keeps model and gradient updates private; differential privacy prevents the training data from leaking. As of today, private and secure deep learning is an emerging technology. In this post, we introduce Syft, an open-source framework that integrates with PyTorch as well as TensorFlow. In an example use case, we obtain private predictions from a Keras model.</description>

      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2020-04-08-tf-federated-intro</link>
      <description>The term "federated learning" was coined to describe a form of distributed model training where the data remains on client devices, i.e., is never shipped to the coordinating server. In this post, we introduce central concepts and run first experiments with TensorFlow Federated, using R.</description>

      <title>Infinite surprise - the iridescent personality of Kullback-Leibler divergence</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2020-02-19-kl-divergence</link>
      <description>Kullback-Leibler divergence is not just used to train variational autoencoders or Bayesian networks (and not just a hard-to-pronounce thing). It is a fundamental concept in information theory, put to use in a vast range of applications. Most interestingly, it's not always about constraint, regularization or compression. Quite on the contrary, sometimes it is about novelty, discovery and surprise.</description>

      <title>NumPy-style broadcasting for R TensorFlow users</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2020-01-24-numpy-broadcasting</link>
      <description>Broadcasting, as done by Python's scientific computing library NumPy, involves dynamically extending shapes so that arrays of different sizes may be passed to operations that expect conformity - such as adding or multiplying elementwise. In NumPy, the way broadcasting works is specified exactly; the same rules apply to TensorFlow operations. For anyone who finds herself, occasionally, consulting Python code, this post strives to explain.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy with TensorFlow</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-12-20-differential-privacy</link>
      <description>Differential Privacy guarantees that results of a database query are basically independent of the presence in the data of a single individual. Applied to machine learning, we expect that no single training example influences the parameters of the trained model in a substantial way. This post introduces TensorFlow Privacy, a library built on top of TensorFlow, that can be used to train differentially private deep learning models from R.</description>

      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-12-10-variational-gaussian-process</link>
      <description>Continuing our tour of applications of TensorFlow Probability (TFP), after Bayesian Neural Networks, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and State Space Models, here we show an example of Gaussian Process Regression. In fact, what we see is a rather "normal" Keras network, defined and trained in pretty much the usual way, with TFP's Variational Gaussian Process layer pulling off all the magic.</description>

      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-11-13-variational-convnet</link>
      <description>In a Bayesian neural network, layer weights are distributions, not tensors. Using tfprobability, the R wrapper to TensorFlow Probability, we can build regular Keras models that have probabilistic layers, and thus get uncertainty estimates "for free". In this post, we show how to define, train and obtain predictions from a probabilistic convolutional neural network.</description>

      <description>Is society ready to deal with challenges brought about by artificially-generated  information - fake images, fake videos, fake text? While this post won't answer that question, it should help form an opinion on the threat exerted by fake text as of this writing, autumn 2019.  We introduce gpt2, an R package that wraps OpenAI's public implementation of GPT-2, the language model that early this year surprised the NLP community with the unprecedented quality of its creations.</description>

      <description>TensorFlow Probability, and its R wrapper tfprobability, provide Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that were used in a number of recent posts on this blog. These posts were directed to users already comfortable with the method, and terminology, per se, which readers mainly interested in deep learning won't necessarily be. Here we try to make up leeway, introducing Hamitonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as well as a few often-heard "buzzwords" accompanying it, always striving to keep in mind what it is all "for".</description>

      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-08-29-using-tf-from-r</link>
      <description>Have you ever wondered why you can call TensorFlow - mostly known as a Python framework - from R? If not - that's how it should be, as the R packages keras and tensorflow aim to make this process as transparent as possible to the user. But for them to be those helpful genies, someone else first has to tame the Python.</description>

      <description>In image segmentation, every pixel of an image is assigned a class. Depending on the application, classes could be different cell types; or the task could be binary, as in "cancer cell yes or no?". Area of application notwithstanding, the established neural network architecture of choice is U-Net. In this post, we show how to preprocess data and train a U-Net model on the Kaggle Carvana image segmentation data.</description>

      <title>Modeling censored data with tfprobability</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-07-31-censored-data</link>
      <description>In this post we use tfprobability, the R interface to TensorFlow Probability, to model censored data. Again, the exposition is inspired by the treatment of this topic in Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking. Instead of cute cats though, we model immaterial entities from the cold world of technology: This post explores durations of CRAN package checks, a dataset that comes with Max Kuhn's parsnip.</description>

      <title>TensorFlow feature columns: Transforming your data recipes-style</title>

      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-07-09-feature-columns</link>
      <description>TensorFlow feature columns provide useful functionality for preprocessing categorical data and chaining transformations, like bucketization or feature crossing. From R, we use them in popular "recipes" style, creating and subsequently refining a feature specification. In this post, we show how using feature specs frees cognitive resources and lets you focus on what you really want to accomplish. What's more, because of its elegance, feature-spec code reads nice and is fun to write as well.</description>

      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-06-25-dynamic_linear_models_tfprobability</link>
      <description>Previous posts featuring tfprobability - the R interface to TensorFlow Probability - have focused on enhancements to deep neural networks (e.g., introducing Bayesian uncertainty estimates) and fitting hierarchical models with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. This time, we show how to fit time series using dynamic linear models (DLMs), yielding posterior predictive forecasts as well as the smoothed and filtered estimates from the Kálmán filter.</description>

      <title>Adding uncertainty estimates to Keras models with tfprobability</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-06-05-uncertainty-estimates-tfprobability</link>
      <description>As of today, there is no mainstream road to obtaining uncertainty estimates from neural networks. All that can be said is that, normally, approaches tend to be Bayesian in spirit, involving some way of putting a prior over model weights. This holds true as well for the method presented in this post: We show how to use tfprobability, the R interface to TensorFlow Probability, to add uncertainty estimates to a Keras model in an elegant and conceptually plausible way.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical partial pooling, continued: Varying slopes models with TensorFlow Probability</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-05-24-varying-slopes</link>
      <description>This post builds on our recent introduction to multi-level modeling with tfprobability, the R wrapper to TensorFlow Probability. We show how to pool not just mean values ("intercepts"), but also relationships ("slopes"), thus enabling models to learn from data in an even broader way. Again, we use an example from Richard McElreath's "Statistical Rethinking"; the terminology as well as the way we present this topic are largely owed to this book.</description>

      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-02-07-audio-background</link>
      <description>Sometimes, deep learning is seen - and welcomed - as a way to avoid laborious preprocessing of data. However, there are cases where preprocessing of sorts does not only help improve prediction, but constitutes a fascinating topic in itself. One such case is audio classification. In this post, we build on a previous post on this blog, this time focusing on explaining some of the non-deep learning background. We then link the concepts explained to updated for near-future releases TensorFlow code.</description>

      <title>Discrete Representation Learning with VQ-VAE and TensorFlow Probability</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-01-24-vq-vae</link>
      <description>Mostly when thinking of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), we picture the prior as an isotropic Gaussian. But this is by no means a necessity. The Vector Quantised Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) described in van den Oord et al's "Neural Discrete Representation Learning" features a discrete latent space that allows to learn impressively concise latent representations. In this post, we combine elements of Keras, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow Probability to see if we can generate convincing letters resembling those in Kuzushiji-MNIST.</description>

      <description>TensorFlow Probability offers a vast range of functionality ranging from distributions over probabilistic network layers to probabilistic inference. It works seamlessly with core TensorFlow and (TensorFlow) Keras. In this post, we provide a short introduction to the distributions layer and then, use it for sampling and calculating probabilities in a Variational Autoencoder.</description>

      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2018-12-18-object-detection-concepts</link>
      <description>As shown in a previous post, naming and locating a single object in an image is a task that may be approached in a straightforward way. This is not the same with general object detection, though - naming and locating several objects at once, with no prior information about how many objects are supposed to be detected.
In this post, we explain the steps involved in coding a basic single-shot object detector: Not unlike SSD (Single-shot Multibox Detector), but simplified and designed not for best performance, but comprehensibility.</description>

      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2018-11-12-uncertainty_estimates_dropout</link>
      <description>In deep learning, there is no obvious way of obtaining uncertainty estimates. In 2016, Gal and Ghahramani proposed a method that is both theoretically grounded and practical: use dropout at test time. In this post, we introduce a refined version of this method (Gal et al. 2017) that has the network itself learn how uncertain it is.</description>

      <description>Like GANs, variational autoencoders (VAEs) are often used to generate images. However, VAEs add an additional promise: namely, to model an underlying latent space. Here, we first look at a typical implementation that maximizes the evidence lower bound. Then, we compare it to one of the more recent competitors, MMD-VAE, from the Info-VAE (information maximizing VAE) family.</description>
