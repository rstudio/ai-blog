    "description": "TensorFlow Probability, and its R wrapper tfprobability, provide Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that were used in a number of recent posts on this blog. These posts were directed to users already comfortable with the method, and terminology, per se, which readers mainly interested in deep learning won't necessarily be. Here we try to make up leeway, introducing Hamitonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as well as a few often-heard \"buzzwords\" accompanying it, always striving to keep in mind what it is all \"for\".",

    "description": "Like GANs, variational autoencoders (VAEs) are often used to generate images. However, VAEs add an additional promise: namely, to model an underlying latent space. Here, we first look at a typical implementation that maximizes the evidence lower bound. Then, we compare it to one of the more recent competitors, MMD-VAE, from the Info-VAE (information maximizing VAE) family.",
