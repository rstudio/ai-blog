Global weather is a chaotic system, but of much higher complexity than many tasks commonly addressed with machine and/or deep learning. In this post, we provide a practical introduction featuring a simple deep learning baseline for atmospheric forecasting. While far away from being competitive, it serves to illustrate how more sophisticated and compute-intensive models may approach that formidable task by means of methods situated on the \"black-box end\" of the continuum.",

    "description": "The kerasformula package offers a high-level interface for the R interface to Keras. It’s main interface is the kms function, a regression-style interface to keras_model_sequential that uses formulas and sparse matrices. We use kerasformula to predict how popular tweets will be based on how often the tweet was retweeted and favorited.",
