If you are interested in publishing some of your own work or insights, we’d love to hear from you!\nArticles posted on the RStudio AI Blog are authored using Distill for R Markdown. The easiest way to contribute a new article is as follows:\nCreate a fork of the RStudio AI blog repository on GitHub.\nIn your fork, create a new branch that will contain your distill article. When you’re done, please check in all files, the Rmd source code as well as the generated HTML.\nBe sure that you’ve included all required article metadata (see below for details).\nPost an issue on the RStudio AI Blog repo requesting that we accept your article (be sure to include a link back to your article’s GitHub repo!).\nOnce we see your issue we’ll take a look at your article, suggest changes as necessary, then publish it when it’s ready.\nArticle metadata\nTo be included in the blog, your article should include some standard metadata fields. Here’s an example of a post that includes all required metadata:\n---\ntitle: \"Classifying physical activity from smartphone data with Keras\"\ndescription: |\n  Using Keras to train a convolutional neural network to classify physical\n  activity. The dataset was built from the recordings of 30 subjects \n  performing basic activities and postural transitions while carrying a \n  waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.\nauthor:\n  - name: Nick Strayer \n    url: http://nickstrayer.me\n    affiliation: Vanderbilt University\n    affiliation_url: https://www.vanderbilt.edu/biostatistics-graduate/\ndate: 07-17-2018\ncreative_commons: CC BY\nrepository_url: https://github.com/nstrayer/activity_detection_post\noutput: \n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n---\nNote that the author field includes a URL for the author as well as their affiliation (you can include multiple authors). Note also the creative_commons field which marks the article as being share-able (all contributed posts must have a Creative Commons license). Finally, the repository_url is used to provide links from the article back to GitHub.\n\n\n\n",
