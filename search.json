If you are interested in publishing some of your\nown work or insights, we’d love to hear from you!\nArticles posted on the Posit AI Blog are authored using Distill for R\nMarkdown. The easiest way to\ncontribute a new article is as follows:\nCreate a fork of the Posit AI blog\nrepository on GitHub.\nIn your fork, create a new branch that will contain your distill\narticle. When you’re done,\nplease check in the raw Rmd plus any static files you might have added to the\npost’s source directory. Don’t check in any generated files, such as html.\nBe sure that you’ve included all required article metadata (see\nbelow for details).\nPost an issue on the\nPosit AI Blog repo requesting that we accept your article (be sure\nto include a link back to your article’s GitHub repo!).\nOnce we see your issue we’ll take a look at your article, suggest\nchanges as necessary, then publish it when it’s ready.\nArticle metadata\nTo be included in the blog, your article should include some standard\nmetadata fields. Here’s an example of a post that includes all required\nmetadata:\n---\ntitle: \"Classifying physical activity from smartphone data with Keras\"\ndescription: |\n  Using Keras to train a convolutional neural network to classify physical\n  activity. The dataset was built from the recordings of 30 subjects\n  performing basic activities and postural transitions while carrying a\n  waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.\nauthor:\n  - name: Nick Strayer\n    url: http://nickstrayer.me\n    affiliation: Vanderbilt University\n    affiliation_url: https://www.vanderbilt.edu/biostatistics-graduate/\ndate: 07-17-2018\ncreative_commons: CC BY\nrepository_url: https://github.com/nstrayer/activity_detection_post\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n---\nNote that the author field includes a URL for the author as well as\ntheir affiliation (you can include multiple authors). Note also the\ncreative_commons field which marks the article as being share-able\n(all contributed posts must have a Creative\nCommons license). Finally, the\nrepository_url is used to provide links from the article back to\nGitHub.\nArticle preview\nPlease note after submitting a PR for this repository, GitHub workflow will\nstart building a preview version of Posit AI blog that includes your article.\nOnce this build completes, a directory named ‘ai-blog-preview’ will be uploaded\nin a zip file as the build artifact. If you would like to browse this preview\nversion locally, please follow the steps in\nDownloading workflow artifacts\nto download ai-blog-preview.zip, unzip it, and open ai-blog-preview/index.html\nin your browser. You should then be able to see your article on the landing page\nof the preview.\n\n\n\n",
